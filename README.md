Hey there, I'm Cloud. 

I am currently working on trying to become a cybersecurity and software professional while also pursuing my entrepreneurial goals.  I also like learning about ML and robotics when I have time, and plan to utilize my skillset to create valuable resources for the software development and cybersecurity community. 

I will be attending ASU in the fall of 2025 for Information Technology and Cybersecurity, and aspire to play for the CTF team Shellphish. I have played for a couple CTF teams like Faithful Followers of Flaherty and RaptX, but I am looking to network with other teams and play for others down the road :) 

Outside of toying with computers and technology, I go on walks, do arts & crafts, write, watch anime, collect TCG cards and play video games.
