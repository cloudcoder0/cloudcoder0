Hey there, I'm Cloud. 

I am currently working on multiple things, such as learning machine learning, cybersecurity, and robotics. I also play CTF challenges to enhance my problem solving skills and give me hands on practice with cybersecurity fundamentals. 

Within those specific fields, for cybersecurity I am mostly trying out everything I can find, but I am working on learning python, bash and powershell to learn how to script and automate tasks, and I am learning how different operating systems work. In CTFs I will be learning every domain a little, but will primarily focus on OSINT, Web Exploitation, and Cryptography.

For machine learning I want to learn tensorflow and python to create computer vision systems. Natural language processing sounds cool too, but computer vision is my top thing at the moment. 

For robotics I want to learn lower level languages to understand how hardware works and maybe make some silly little arduino projects :) 

Outside of learning all of this, I have other hobbies such as gaming, journaling, reading, watching anime, playing with my cats, going outside and exploring, and just overall learning random stuff in general lol 

I hope that my repositories help someone out there, as I believe knowledge should be shared to everyone.
